<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a motivated professional from the healthcare industry with a strong
  background as a unit manager and nurse. However, I have noticed a growing need
  in the modern work environment for individuals with combined expertise in
  healthcare and IT. To address this need, I decided to expand my skills and
  pursue education in new areas. I completed an accelerated learning program at
  AW Academy in Amazon Web Services, which provided me with a solid foundation
  in cloud services and IT skills. I have experience with various programming
  languages such as JavaScript and Node.js, AWS technologies, databases, and
  integrations.

  projects and handling responsibilities. My communication and organizational
