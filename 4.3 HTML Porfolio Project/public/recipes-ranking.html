    <h3>üêü Wild salmon-soup</h3>
    <p>
      Cooked over open fire on the beach in the Finnish arcipelago. With the
      freshly fished wild salmon and locally grown potatoes and dill, this makes
      a solid 11/10.
    </p>
    <h3>ü•ó Cooked asparagus and gravlax with Bearnaise</h3>
    <p>
      Salting the wild salmon for one day and making the Bearnaise from scratch,
      will surely blow you away as well. Serve with a piece of traditional
      archipelagian dark malt-bread and a pouched egg to lux it up even further.

    <h3>ü•î Finnish new potatoes with nappaspad, aka ludiveet√•</h3>
    <p>
      Ludiv√§√§t√• is a cold runny sauce consisting of heavy cream, spring-onion,
      chives, dill, salt and black pepper. Depending on your origin, you may
      call it nappaspad or ludiveet√•. Make sure you make it well in advance
      before serving, so the flavours really have tave time to infuse the cream
      and do not overcook the potatoes. For an early death, serve with a
      generous dollop of butter.
